this is project2 in codeacedemy php course to be familiar with function concept.

Mad Lib Functions
In this project, we’ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
Words to fill in those blanks.
“Roses are Red” poem example:

Mad Libs Example

For this project, we provide the story, but it will be up to you to create a function that:

Takes desired words as arguments.
Returns the story with the words put into blanks in the right place.
Let’s begin!


<?php
function generateStory($singular_noun
,$verb
,$color,$distance_unit){
  $story="\nThe $singular_noun are lovely, $color, and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And $distance_unit to go before I $verb,
And $distance_unit to go before I $verb.\n";

  return $story;
  };

echo generateStory("flowers", "eat", "red","50km");
echo generateStory("dog", "play", "purple","5km");
echo generateStory("parrot", "eat", "green","10km");
echo generateStory("bike", "goes", "grey","100km");
